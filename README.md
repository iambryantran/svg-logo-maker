# SVG Logo Maker

## Description

This repository is where I created an SVG Logo Maker as an assignment for a coding bootcamp. Key concepts practiced with this assignment include: test driven development, class constructors, promises, fs writefile, importing and exporting functions.

## Usage

- Requires Node v12+. (This app has only been tested on Node 16)
- Run `npm install` to download dependencies.
- Run `node index.js` to start the app.
  - Answer questions to generate a logo.
  - Logo will be written to `logo.svg` in the working directory.
